# Analysing graduation outcomes at a University

**Business Problem**

Academic success of students is important for any university. It was observed that a large of proportion of students either drop out of their course or take a longer time to graduate. The university want to understand why some students are not able to complete their studies as intended and want recommendation on how the situation can be improved.

**Data**

The dataset contains information regarding the demoraphy and socio-economic conditions of students at the time of enrollment. It also have some information regarding the performance of the student before joining and in the first two semesters at the university.

**Insights**

* 32% of the students have dropped out and another 18% students graduated late.
* The following 5 courses have very high dropout and require immediate attention
    * Biofuel production technologies(70%)
    * Informatics engineering(56%)
    * Equinculture(51%)
    * Basic Education(45%)
    * Management(evening attendance)(45%)
* Male students are almost as twice as likely to dropout than female students(Dropout rates are 24% and 45% respectively).
* 40% of the dropouts are 25 years or older at the time of enrollment. While more than 80% of the students graduated are younger than 25.
* There isn't any evidence to suggest that students with educational special needs are doing any worse than the rest of the students.
* Parents' background have an impact on graduation outcomes
    * Students whose parents have finished highschool are slightly more likely to graduate than those haven't. But students whose parents have a bachelors degree or higher are more likely to dropout or graduate late
    * Students who parents are blue collar workers are more likely to graduate than that of white collar workers.
    * Higher dropout rates are observed among students whose parent is not working.
* The dropout rate among indebted students are very high(64%)
* High dropout rates are observed among students who have joined after completing highschool or a bachelors degree. But majority of students joining after secondary school are graduating.
* Most of the students who dropout, do so before completing their first or second semester. Those dropout after have a lower grade compared to others.
